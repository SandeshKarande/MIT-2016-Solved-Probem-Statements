#Problem Statement:-Saving with Raise
        
        #Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you save up enough money for a down payment. 
#LIke before, assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (or 4%) and the required down payment percentage is 0.25 (or 25%).

#program should ask the user to enter the following variables:
        #1.The starting annual salary (annual_salary) 2
        #2.The percentage of salary to be saved (portion_saved) 
        #3.The cost of your dream home (total_cost) 
        #4.The semiannual salary raise (semi_annual_raise)
        

annual_salary = float(input("Enter your annual salary"))
portion_saved = float(input("Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal"))
total_cost = float(input("Enter the cost of your dream home"))
semi_annual_raise = float(input("Enter the semiÂ­annual raise, as a decimal"))

    months += 1
    
    if months % 6 == 0:
